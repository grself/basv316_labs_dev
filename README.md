# BASV 316 Lab Manual

I have taught BASV 316, *Introductory Methods of Analysis*, online for the University of Arizona in Sierra Vista since 2010 and enjoy working with students on research methodology. From the start, I wanted students to work with statistics as part of our studies and carry out the types of calculations that are discussed in the text. As I evaluated statistical software I had three criteria:

* Open Educational Resource (OER). It is important to me that students use software that is available free of charge and is supported by the entire web community. 

* Platform. While most of my students use a Windows-based system, some use Macintosh and it was important to me to use software that is available for all of those platforms. As a bonus, most OER software is also available for the Linux system, though I’m not aware of any of my students who are using Linux. Finally, I occasionally have students who are not able to load software on their personal computers (think: Chromebook) so I needed an online capability.

* Longevity. I wanted a system that could be used in other college classes or in a business setting after graduation. That way, any time a student spends learning the software in my class will be an investment that can yield results for many years. 

*R* met those objectives so that is the software I chose to use. This manual started as a series of six lab exercises but has grown over the years to the ten topics covered in this edition. It is my hope that students will find the labs instructive and they will then be able to use *R* for other classes or later in their professional careers. 

The labs use tutorials written with *DataCamp Light* and must be served as HTML documents rather than markdown so they are served from gself.com (my personal server). This lab manual was written with *R Bookdown* and is published under a Creative Commons license with a goal that other instructors can modify and use it to meet their own needs. I always welcome comments and will improve this manual as I receive feedback.
