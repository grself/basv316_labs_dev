Data frame names are enclosed in single asterisks: *trees*

Variable names are are enclosed in single asterisks: *Volume* (consider also including the data frame name, like *trees$Volume*)

Math formulas (inline) are not formated in any special way (note, enclosing in single dollar signs: $(1.5*IQR)$ creates a font that is larger and bolder than the surrounding font and looks bad).

Math blocks are enclosed in double dollar signs and aligned:

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  Lower &= Q1 - (1.5 * IRQ)  \\
  Lower &= 19.40 - (1.5 * 17.9)  \\
  Lower &= 19.40 - 26.85  \\
  Lower &= 0
  \end{aligned}
  $$

The words "r", "rho", and "tau" are italicised (inside asterisks): *r* *rho* and *tau*

For text blocks:

<div class="grsnote">
This is just a block of text.
</div>
